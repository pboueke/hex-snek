# Hex Snek

A very simple hexagonal-based sneak game created to demonstrate the viability of an [Unihexgrid](http://pboueke.github.io/b/projects/). Also because it was fun.

Made with pure JS for the game logic and OCanvas for the canvas manipulation. You can play the game [here](https://pboueke.github.io/hex-snek/) or you can download and build the source into an electron app.
